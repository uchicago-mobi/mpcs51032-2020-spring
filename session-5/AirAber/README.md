## watchOS 4 Tutorial Part 3 Complete

This is the complete project for this 3-part tutorial.

The Watch app displays a list of Air Aber flights. Selecting a flight displays information about the flight, and lets the user check-in. There is an image sequence animation for the check-in action, and a color-change animation in the table, to indicate the flight's checked-in state.
